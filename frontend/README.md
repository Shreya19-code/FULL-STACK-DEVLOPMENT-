# Daily Vibes — Ready Frontend

This is a ready-to-run React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the *Daily Vibes* quotes app.
It includes **mocked local authentication** (register/login) that uses `localStorage` so you can test the auth flow without a backend.

How to run
1. cd into the project folder
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:5173

Notes
- To connect to your real backend later, edit `src/api/api.js` to point to your server.
- Do NOT put your MongoDB Atlas URI in the frontend.
